Documenation and Instructions
---

<p>This Template can be used to create Automic Jobs based on SQL that selects all SQL Agent Jobs in MS SQL Server. The Form Tab is great if you have a few Jobs, but when you try to "convert" 100s of SQL Agent Jobs to Automic Jobs, then this little template can be you friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run it you will need to adjust the Variables in the Workflow to match your enviornment. I also added a Breakpoint after the&nbsp;JOBS.SQL.FIND_JOBS, so you can verify the output and the SQL_DEFINED_JOBS variable.&nbsp;</p>
